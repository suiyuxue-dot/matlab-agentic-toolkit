# MATLAB Agentic Toolkit
The MATLAB&reg; Agentic Toolkit brings trusted MATLAB capabilities to AI agents, making engineering and scientific workflows agent-ready.

## What It Does
AI coding agents are increasingly capable with MATLAB — but capability isn't expertise. Without guidance, agents reinvent what toolbox functions already provide, miss features they don't know about, and burn through extra steps that an experienced MATLAB user would skip. The MATLAB Agentic Toolkit gives your agent the knowledge and context to work efficiently from the start.

The toolkit connects your AI agent to MATLAB and equips it with expert knowledge — the workflows, conventions, and best practices to make the best use of MATLAB while minimizing token burn. Your agent learns to write idiomatic code, generate and run tests, diagnose errors, build apps, and more.

The toolkit works with today's leading AI coding agents and is designed to evolve as the landscape changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use AI agents with Simulink&reg;, install the [Simulink Agentic Toolkit](https://github.com/matlab/simulink-agentic-toolkit). If you plan to use both toolkits, consider the [alternative installer](#alternative-installer) — it sets up both in one step.

## How It Works
The toolkit has two jobs. First, it gives your agent a live connection to MATLAB — so it can run code, execute tests, and analyze results, not just read and write files. Second, it provides curated expertise (called *skills*) that teach your agent how an experienced MATLAB engineer would approach a task. Your agent reads the relevant skill, then uses the MATLAB connection to do the work.

The toolkit ships automated setup for all supported platforms. Clone the repository, launch your agent, and ask it to set up the toolkit.


## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Setup | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) | Automated | Also supports [no-clone marketplace install](#claude-code-marketplace-install) (skills only) |
| [GitHub&reg; Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | Automated | |
| [OpenAI&reg; Codex](https://openai.com/codex) | Automated | |
| [Gemini&trade; CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | Automated | |
| [Sourcegraph Amp](https://ampcode.com/) | Automated | |

> Automated setup has been verified with basic workflows on each platform. The toolkit is under active development — please [report issues](https://github.com/matlab/matlab-agentic-toolkit/issues) if you encounter problems.

## Quick Start

> **Full walkthrough:** See the [Getting Started guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed instructions, platform-specific notes, verification steps, and troubleshooting.

**Prerequisites:**
* MATLAB R2020b or later
* Supported AI coding agent
* Git&trade;

The MATLAB Agentic Toolkit helps you install and configure the [MATLAB MCP Core Server](https://github.com/matlab/matlab-mcp-core-server), or can be configured to use your existing installation.

### Full Setup (recommended)

Clone the repository, launch your agent from the toolkit directory, and ask it to set up the toolkit.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matlab/matlab-agentic-toolkit.git
cd matlab-agentic-toolkit
```

Launch your agent (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, etc.) and ask:

```
Set up the MATLAB Agentic Toolkit
```

Setup looks for your MATLAB installation(s), downloads the MCP server, writes your agent's global configuration, and registers skills. Once complete, start a new session in any project directory — MATLAB tools and skills are available everywhere.

> **Claude Code — no clone required:** If you already have the [MCP server](https://github.com/matlab/matlab-mcp-core-server) configured, you can add skills directly without cloning:
> ```bash
> claude plugin marketplace add "https://github.com/matlab/matlab-agentic-toolkit"
> claude plugin install matlab-core@matlab-agentic-toolkit
> ```
> This installs skills only. Your existing MCP configuration is not modified. See the [Getting Started guide](GETTING_STARTED.md#adding-skills-only) for details.

### Already Have the MCP Server?

If you installed the [MATLAB MCP Core Server](https://github.com/matlab/matlab-mcp-core-server) yourself, you just need skills. See [Adding Skills Only](GETTING_STARTED.md#adding-skills-only) in the Getting Started guide.

### Alternative Installer (experimental)

The Simulink Agentic Toolkit provides a MATLAB-based installer that can install and configure both toolkits. This installer offers several benefits over the current `matlab-agentic-toolkit-setup` skill:
* It can install both the MATLAB and Simulink Agentic Toolkits. It is recommended for users who would like to use both
* It supports the MATLAB MCP Core Server option to connect to an existing MATLAB session (`--matlab-session-mode=existing`)
* It provides the option to configure your agent to use the toolkits for individual projects, not just globally
* This installer does not consume agent tokens

The tradeoff is that it is newer and less thoroughly tested than the agent-driven setup above.

1. Download `agenticToolkitInstaller.mltbx` from the [Simulink Agentic Toolkit releases page](https://github.com/matlab/simulink-agentic-toolkit/releases).
2. Open the downloaded file to install the installer add-on.
3. In MATLAB, run: `setupAgenticToolkit`

### Verify
Ask your agent:

```
What version of MATLAB is running? List the installed toolboxes.
```

## MCP Tools
Provided by the [MATLAB MCP Core Server](https://github.com/matlab/matlab-mcp-core-server):

| Tool | What your agent can do |
|------|------------------------|
| `evaluate_matlab_code` | Run MATLAB code and return command window output |
| `run_matlab_file` | Run a MATLAB program |
| `run_matlab_test_file` | Run tests via `runtests` with structured results |
| `check_matlab_code` | Static analysis with the Code Analyzer |
| `detect_matlab_toolboxes` | List installed MATLAB version and toolboxes |

The server also provides two MCP resources: `matlab_coding_guidelines` (coding standards) and `plain_text_live_code_guidelines` (Live Script format rules).

We welcome feedback through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/matlab/matlab-agentic-toolkit/issues). Pull requests are reviewed for ideas and feedback but are not merged from external contributors. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Security Considerations
When using the MATLAB Agentic Toolkit and MATLAB MCP Core Server, you should thoroughly review and validate all tool calls before you run them. Always keep a human in the loop for important actions and only proceed once you are confident the call will do exactly what you expect.
